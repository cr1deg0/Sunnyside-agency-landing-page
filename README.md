## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties and utility classes
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge as been great to practice CSS Flex and Grid, as well as working with images in responsive layouts. 

My solution contains two layout designs, one for laptop and one for mobile, however I've implemented responsive font-sizes to allow for a seamless transition between the two without distorting the image layout.

It has challenged me also to look for solutions on how to implement underlines with CSS pseudo-elements and how to implemet hover and active states on them.
